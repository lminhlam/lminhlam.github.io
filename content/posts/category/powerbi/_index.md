You might have an idea in your mind, but perhaps you haven't fully thought through all the details and information you need to create an app. You might be a business user or IT pro who has never designed or built an app before. Or you might be a full stack developer who wants to know how working with Power Apps is different from traditional app development.

In these articles, regardless of your background or how much you know about app development, you'll learn about the steps to convert your ideas into a fully working solution by using Power Apps.

1. [Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/planning/planning-phase): Identify the who, what, when, and why.
2. [Design](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/planning/designing-phase): Model the data (decide how the data you need and create will be organized, accessed, and stored) and sketch out the app screens.
3. [Make](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/planning/making-phase): Create the app.
4. [Test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/planning/testing-phase): Have users try the app.
5. [Deploy and refine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/planning/discoverability): Get your app into the hands of users, get feedback, and decide what to change or add.
